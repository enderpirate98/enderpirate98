- Just a tech nerd who wants to be the IT guy someday.
- I am not a software dev but I do sometimes write helpful guides on technical things!
- My latest guide is my CachyOS config install on other distros which you can find here: https://github.com/enderpirate98/Cachyos-look-and-feel
- I am working on the ultimate OpenSUSE Tumbleweed install atm!
