- Just a tech nerd who wants to be the IT guy someday.
- I am not a software dev but I do sometimes write helpful guides on technical things!
- My latest guides are my CachyOS config install on other distros which you can find here: https://github.com/enderpirate98/Cachyos-look-and-feel as well as the ultimate OpenSUSE Tumbleweed install which you can find here: https://github.com/enderpirate98/Minimal-OpenSUSE-TW-Install
- I did make a Fedora Minimal install guide but it is not that great but if you want here it is: https://github.com/enderpirate98/fedora-minimal
- I am working on a guide on how to have a more private and secure Android phone which you can find here: https://github.com/enderpirate98/private-phone
